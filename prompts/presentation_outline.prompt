**Summarized Web Results:** {summarized_web}
**Summarized Local Document Results:** {summarized_local}

# Formatting Guidelines / Output Structure

*   Use nested bullet points for sub-points or details.
*   Include placeholder suggestions like `[Insert relevant image/chart]` where appropriate.

# Constraints / Rules / Error Handling

*   Organize the slides logically, potentially using the Table of Contents structure ({toc_str}) as a guide if provided and relevant.
*   Focus on structuring the information clearly for presentation slides, not on writing full slide content or prose.
